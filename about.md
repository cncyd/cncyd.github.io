I am a student pursuing my MSc in Finance at UBC Sauder. Although my academic pursuits keep me busy, I find solace and creativity in writing modern Chinese poetry, especially when I'm feeling reflective or introspective.

To share my passion for poetry with others and express my thoughts and emotions, I've created a blog dedicated to my modern Chinese poems. Through my blog, I hope to connect with readers who appreciate poetry and share my love for the Chinese language.

Aside from personal expression, I also want to use my blog as a platform to challenge myself and improve my poem writing skills. By publishing my poems publicly, I feel more accountable for the quality of my work and the message I convey. I hope that my poems can resonate with readers and provide a unique perspective on modern life and emotions. Thank you for visiting my website and I look forward to sharing more of my work with you.
