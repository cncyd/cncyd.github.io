I am currently a senior student in the school of physics at Peking University. I have switched my interests from physics to finance and will go to SAIF for PhD in Finance.

### Why I have this blog

First is that I want to express and record my feelings. More importantly, 
speaking up on a public website push me to take my views and language more seriously. If you disagree with my opinion, feel free to text me.
