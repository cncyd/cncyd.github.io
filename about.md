I am currently a senior student in the school of physics at Peking University. I have switched my research interests from physics to finance and will go to SAIF for Ph.D. I always enjoy skiing\climbing and writing whining poems in my spare time. 


### Why I have this blog

First is that I want to express and record my feelings. More importantly, speaking up on a public website pushes me to take my views and language seriously.
