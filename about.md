<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3"> Hi, I am currently a finance PhD student. Although my academic pursuits keep me busy, I find solace and creativity in writing modern Chinese poetry.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">To share my passion for poetry with others and express my thoughts and emotions, I’ve created a blog dedicated to my modern Chinese poems. Through my blog, I hope to connect with readers who appreciate poetry and share my love for the Chinese language.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7"> I hope that my poems can provide a unique perspective on modern life and emotions. Thank you for visiting my website and I look forward to sharing more of my work with you.</p>
博客建成，《毛诗序》曰“诗者，志之所之也。在心为志，发言为诗。”一直很喜欢书写，如今使用公共网站，是迈向自我暴露的第一步。2020-9-14
